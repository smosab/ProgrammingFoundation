  1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
  
  Casual:
  
  Ask the user for the first integer.
  save the integer in a variable called integer1.

  Ask the user for the second integer.
  Save the integer in a variable called integer2.

  Add integer1 to integer2 and store in a variable called result.

  Print out the result.

  
  Formal:
  
  START

  PRINT "This program returns the sum of two integers."
  
  PRINT "Please enter the first integer."
  SET intger1 = user input

  PRINT "Please enter the second integer."
  SET intger2 = user input

  result = integer1 + integer2

  PRINT "The sum of the two integers is :" result

  END

  2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

  Casual:

  Accept an array of strings by loading the values into a string variable called strings.
    -Iterate through the array and extract the first string in the array.
      -Append each string in the array to the newly created strings variable.
      -After iterating through the collection, print out the string.

  Formal:

  START

  # Given an array of strings called "array"

  SET iterator = length of the array
  SET strings = " "

  WHILE the iterator > 1
    SET strings = strings + next string from the array 

    iterator = iterator - 1

    PRINT string

  END

  3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

  Casual:

  Given an array of integers.

    Iterate through the array.
      -Assign the next integer to a new array called array{n}, where n is the index of the integer in the array.
      -Skip an array by adding 1 to the index of the next integer in the array.

  Formal:

  START
  
  #Given an array of integers called integerarray.

  SET iterator = length of array
  
  WHILE iterator > 0

  SET n = index of the next array
  SET array{n} = next integer in array

  END
